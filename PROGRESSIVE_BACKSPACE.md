# Progressive Backspace Feature

## Overview

The Progressive Backspace feature provides a controlled deletion mechanism where each backspace operation only deletes the next character if the previous character has been successfully deleted. This creates a more deliberate and controlled text deletion experience.

## How It Works

### Basic Behavior

1. **First Backspace**: When you press backspace for the first time, it deletes the character before the cursor as normal and activates progressive deletion mode.

2. **Subsequent Backspaces**: Once in progressive deletion mode, subsequent backspace presses will only delete characters that are immediately adjacent to the previously deleted position.

3. **Position Validation**: If you try to delete from a different position (e.g., by clicking elsewhere), the backspace will not work until you reset the progressive deletion state.

4. **Auto-Reset**: Progressive deletion automatically resets after 2 seconds of inactivity.

### State Management

The feature adds two new properties to the keyboard state:

- `lastDeletedPosition: number | null` - Tracks the position of the last deleted character
- `progressiveDeletionActive: boolean` - Indicates whether progressive deletion mode is active

### Reset Conditions

Progressive deletion is reset when:

1. **Time-based**: After 2 seconds of inactivity
2. **Text input**: When typing any regular character
3. **Space key**: When pressing space
4. **Text selection**: When deleting selected text
5. **Word deletion**: When using Ctrl+Backspace to delete words
6. **Component unmount**: Cleanup when the component is destroyed

## Implementation Details

### Core Logic

```typescript
// Progressive deletion: only allow deletion of the next character if previous was deleted
if (state.progressiveDeletionActive && state.lastDeletedPosition !== null) {
  // Check if we're trying to delete the expected next character
  if (currentPosition !== state.lastDeletedPosition) {
    // Not the expected position, don't delete
    return { newValue: currentValue };
  }
}
```

### Timer Management

```typescript
// Set up timer to reset progressive deletion after 2 seconds of inactivity
progressiveDeletionTimerRef.current = setTimeout(() => {
  setState(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    progressiveDeletionActive: false,
    lastDeletedPosition: null,
  }));
  progressiveDeletionTimerRef.current = null;
}, 2000);
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Deliberate Text Editing
- Prevents accidental deletion of text when rapidly pressing backspace
- Ensures users are aware of what they're deleting

### 2. Educational Applications
- Helps users understand character-by-character deletion
- Provides visual feedback about deletion progress

### 3. Accessibility
- Reduces anxiety for users who are afraid of deleting too much text
- Provides more control over text deletion

## User Experience

### Visual Feedback
- The feature works transparently with existing UI
- No additional visual indicators are currently implemented
- Could be enhanced with visual cues showing progressive deletion state

### Interaction Flow
1. User types some text: "Hello World"
2. User presses backspace once → deletes "d", progressive mode activated
3. User presses backspace again → deletes "l" (adjacent character)
4. User clicks elsewhere and presses backspace → no deletion (position changed)
5. After 2 seconds of inactivity → progressive mode resets

## Configuration

Currently, the progressive backspace feature is:
- **Always enabled** for single character deletion
- **Disabled** for word deletion (Ctrl+Backspace)
- **Disabled** when text is selected
- **Auto-reset** after 2 seconds (configurable in code)

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Visual Indicators**: Show when progressive deletion is active
2. **Configurable Timeout**: Allow users to set custom reset timeout
3. **Sound Feedback**: Audio cues for progressive deletion state
4. **Customizable Behavior**: Option to enable/disable the feature
5. **Multiple Deletion Modes**: Different progressive deletion strategies

### Advanced Features
1. **Deletion Preview**: Show what will be deleted next
2. **Undo Integration**: Better integration with undo/redo functionality
3. **Position Highlighting**: Highlight the expected deletion position
4. **Gesture Support**: Touch-based progressive deletion for mobile

## Browser Compatibility

The feature uses standard JavaScript APIs and should work in all modern browsers:
- **setTimeout/clearTimeout**: For timing management
- **React useRef**: For timer reference storage
- **React useState/useEffect**: For state management

## Performance Considerations

- **Memory**: Minimal overhead with two additional state properties
- **CPU**: Lightweight timer management
- **Clean-up**: Proper timer cleanup prevents memory leaks
- **Re-renders**: Optimized state updates to minimize re-renders

## Testing

To test the progressive backspace feature:

1. Type some text in the keyboard input
2. Press backspace once to enter progressive mode
3. Try pressing backspace multiple times in sequence
4. Try clicking elsewhere and pressing backspace (should not work)
5. Wait 2 seconds and press backspace (should work normally)
6. Try typing text or pressing space (should reset progressive mode)

## Integration

The feature is fully integrated into the existing `useKeyboard` hook and doesn't require any changes to consuming components. The progressive deletion state is managed internally and resets appropriately based on user interactions.
