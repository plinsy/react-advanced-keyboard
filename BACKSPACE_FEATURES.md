# Enhanced Backspace & Delete Features

## Summary of Improvements

The backspace and delete functionality has been significantly enhanced with the following features:

### üîÑ **Progressive Long-Press Deletion**
- **Accelerated timing**: Starts at 200ms intervals and speeds up to 50ms for rapid deletion
- **Visual feedback**: Keys pulse red during long-press operations
- **Smooth acceleration**: Uses exponential decay for natural feeling speed increase
- **Both keys supported**: Works for both Backspace and Delete keys

### üéØ **Word-Level Deletion**
- **Ctrl+Backspace**: Deletes words or whitespace before the cursor
- **Ctrl+Delete**: Deletes words or whitespace after the cursor
- **Smart detection**: Distinguishes between word characters and whitespace
- **Boundary aware**: Stops at word boundaries for precise control

### ‚úÇÔ∏è **Enhanced Selection Handling**
- **Instant deletion**: Selected text is deleted immediately with either key
- **Cursor positioning**: Proper cursor placement after deletion
- **No partial deletions**: Entire selections are removed atomically

### üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Improvements**
- **Race condition fixes**: Uses atomic state updates for consistent behavior
- **Better state management**: Functional updates prevent stale state issues
- **Improved focus handling**: Maintains input focus during operations
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Works consistently across different platforms

## Testing the Features

### In the Backspace Demo (`/backspace-demo`):

1. **Single Character Deletion**:
   - Position cursor and press Backspace/Delete
   - Observe single character removal

2. **Long-Press Deletion**:
   - Hold down Backspace or Delete key
   - Watch the red pulsing effect
   - Notice the acceleration over time

3. **Word Deletion**:
   - Position cursor after a word
   - Hold Ctrl and press Backspace
   - Entire word should be deleted

4. **Selection Deletion**:
   - Use selection buttons to select text
   - Press Backspace or Delete
   - Entire selection disappears instantly

5. **Mixed Operations**:
   - Test combinations of selection + word deletion
   - Try rapid typing followed by deletion
   - Verify cursor positioning accuracy

## Code Architecture

The enhanced functionality is implemented across:

- **`useKeyboard.ts`**: Core deletion logic with atomic state updates
- **`Key.tsx`**: Long-press detection and visual feedback
- **`BackspaceDemo.tsx`**: Comprehensive testing interface

The implementation ensures backward compatibility while adding powerful new features for professional text editing experiences.
